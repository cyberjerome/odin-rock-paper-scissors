# odin-rock-paper-scissors
This project is a simple implementation of the Rock Paper Scissors game in JavaScript. It allows the player to play a 5-round game against the computer and keeps track of the scores. At the end of the game, it declares the winner or loser based on the scores.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser. This will display a basic user interface for the game.

3. The game will prompt you to enter your choice for each round. You can choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors by typing the corresponding word (case-insensitive).

4. After each round, the game will display the results on the console, including the round number, player's choice, computer's choice, and the outcome of the round (win, lose, or tie).

5. The game will continue for 5 rounds, and at the end, it will display the overall winner or loser based on the scores.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure for the user interface.
- CSS: Adds basic styling to the user interface.
- JavaScript: Implements the game logic, including player input, computer choice, and score tracking.

## File Structure

The project repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that displays the user interface.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that provides basic styling for the user interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the game logic and function definitions.
- `README.md`: This README file providing an overview and instructions for the project.
